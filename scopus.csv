The investigation advances the state-of-the-art by addressing some fundamental but largely unaddressed issues in the field. These issues include (a) how to extract the main shape and deformation characteristics of the earthworm’s body and build a generic model, (b) how to coordinate the deformations of different segments such that steady-state planar locomotion can be achieved, and (c) how different locomotion gaits would qualitatively and quantitatively affect the robot’s locomotion performance, and how to evaluate them. Learning from earthworms’ unique morphology characteristics, a generic kinematic model of earthworm-like metameric locomotion robots is developed. Left/right-contracted segments are introduced into the model to achieve planar locomotion. Then, this paper proposes a gait-generation algorithm by mimicking the earthworm’s retrograde peristalsis wave, with which all admissible locomotion gaits can be constructed. We discover that when controlled by different gaits, the robot would exhibit four qualitatively different locomotion modes, namely, rectilinear, sidewinding, circular, and cycloid locomotion. For each mode, kinematic indexes are defined and examined to characterize their locomotion performances. For verification, a proof-of-concept robot hardware is designed and prototyped. Experiments reveal that with the proposed robot model and the employed gait controls, locomotion of different modes can be effectively achieved, and they agree well with the theoretical predictions.

The main issue of routing in IoD is that the drones are mobile in nature, hence causing frequent topology changes. We optimized the topology for efficient communication in IoD by means of efficient CH election based on the connectivity with the BS along with the residual energy and position of the drones. The cluster is managed according to the DA by updating the position of the drones. Furthermore, for route selection we propose an optimal path selection based on the residual energy and position of drone for efficient communication. The results of our proposed BICIoD are compared with ACO and GWO clustering algorithms. The results show our BICIoD has better performance as compared with the other bio-inspired clustering algorithms in terms of cluster building time, energy consumption, cluster lifetime, and probability of successful delivery. The results indicate that the proposed scheme has improved 60% and 38% with respect to ACO and GWO, respectively, in terms of average cluster building time while average energy consumption has improved 23% and 33%, when compared to ACO and GWO, respectively. In the future work, we will improve the overall performance of the proposed scheme by using hybrid methodology.

En diversos trabajos se utilizan AE para regular las variables de salida del motor síncrono, pero principalmente se han enfocado en algoritmos genéticos (AG) y optimización por enjambre de partículas (OEP) [9,10]. Aunque estos algoritmos son una buena opción para el diseño del controlador del MSIP, en algunos casos cuando la búsqueda es muy selectiva pueden presentar complicaciones de convergencia lenta y en ocasiones los resultados pueden caer en mínimos locales. Recientemente han surgido técnicas basadas en AE, denominados bio-inspirados, como son: algoritmo de búsqueda del murciélago (ABM) [11], algoritmo de optimización la ballena (AOB) [12] y algoritmo de búsqueda cuckoo (ABC) [13].","donde vd y vq son los voltajes aplicados en el estator en un marco de referencia dq (entradas de control), respectivamente; id e iq son las corrientes en un marco de referencia dq; rs es la resistencia en el estator; Ld y Lq son las inductancias propias del estator en un marco de referencia dq; ωe es la velocidad angular eléctrica del rotor; y λm es el flujo magnético producido por el imán permanente en el rotor. En este trabajo, para realizar el estudio se utiliza un MSIP de polos no salientes con los imanes montados en la superficie del rotor [26], por lo cual las inductancias en eje d y eje q, son iguales, en consecuencia el par electromagnético (Te) se puede definir como sigue:",,,"IEEE Computer Society"

Over the past 6 years, he has been conducting scientific research on several areas, namely robotics, computer vision, sports engineering, and others, all at the Institute of Systems and Robotics (ISR-FCTUC) and RoboCorp (IPC). This resulted on more than 25 scientific articles in international impact factor journals and more than 50 scientific articles at international conferences. Besides being currently a researcher at ISR, he has been invited for lecturing, tutoring and organisation of events (e.g., professional courses, national and international conferences, among others), both in the public and private domains. He is co-founder and currently the CEO of Ingeniarius.","We acknowledge the support of the School of Engineering and Physical Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh through ‘Remission of Fees’ and the School of Mathematical and Computer Sciences, Heriot-Watt University, Edinburgh through a visiting researcher fellowship.
